The way to compile the program:

1. The queue structure is defined in the header file "Queue.h", please make sure that "Queue.h" is in the same folder with "55199998.cpp"

2. To compile the program, use the following command line is enough (SFIFO can be changed to any name you like)

        g++ 55199998.cpp -o SFIFO -lpthread

3. To shorten the command line, you can add the following script in your "~/.bashrc".
    
        alias p_rua='run(){g++ -lpthread "$1"};run'
        alias pn_rua='run(){g++ -lpthread "$1" -o "$2"};run'
   
   Then you can activate it by:

        source ~/.bashrc

   After that, you can simply call:

        pn_rua 55199998.cpp SFIFO
