Possible output of the program:

1. If the user call the executable file with more or less than 2 variables, the program will output and terminate:

        Usage: $ ./Filename max_token flow_interval(only accept 2 variables)

2. If one of the variables is zero, the program will output and terminate

        Max_token and flow_interval cannot be 0

3. If the variables are correctly inputted, the main thread will print the header of the table
    
        Flow         Queue                                  Server
        Token added  Latest sequence number Current Length  Token served Total Token fetched


4. If there is something wrong with creating client/server thread, the program will output and terminate:
    
        Error when creating client/server thread!

5. If the 2 threads are started successfully, they will do the simulation and print

        aaa          bbb                    ccc            
                                            zzz             xxx          yyy

   where aaa is random number generated by client, bbb is the last sequence number, ccc and zzz is the current queue length,
   xxx is the token fetched in the current round, yyy is the total token fetched

6. If there is something wrong with joining client/server thread, the program will output and terminate:
    
        Error when joining client/server thread!
